### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, the first lab was the beginning of my learning coding, which made me feel the curiosity brought by the code and the happiness when "Hello World" appeared in the terminal.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part-1 is a word game where players fill out words to form sentences about sandwich lists. This is interesting because you need to verify that the number of arguments is correct, and if it's not, an error message will be printed.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, I like part-1 because it ends up printing. When I use a for loop every next line add underscore , delet vertical  bar to see printed pattern after I over the magic of the code.
